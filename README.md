ðŸ’€ IoT Annihilator: The Last Thing Your IoT Wants to See ðŸ’€

IoT Annihilator doesnâ€™t play nice. This tool is pure chaos for any IoT device dumb enough to be left unguarded. Scan, brute-force, and exploit every weak spot with the full force of Metasploit, Hydra, Nmap, and RouterSploit. If youâ€™re looking for stealth and speed, IoT Annihilator has you covered.

ðŸ”¥ What This Beast Does

    Total Domination: Combines Nmap, Hydra, Metasploit, and RouterSploit to obliterate any IoT device left exposed.
    Anonymous Havoc: With Proxychains, cloak your moves and hit hard without a trace.
    Multi-Threaded Aggression: Parallel execution means it attacks at high speed, leaving no service safe.
    Outdated Service Smasher: Easily identifies old versions to help you choose targets for the most impact.

ðŸ“œ Requirements

    Python 3.6+
    Proxychains and a list of proxies in proxies.txt
    Install the Good Stuff: Nmap, Hydra, Metasploit, and RouterSploit

ðŸ›‘ Warning: Use at Your Own RiskðŸ›‘

IoT Annihilator doesnâ€™t care about limits, but maybe you should. This tool is for educational purposes and illegal reasons onlyâ€”donâ€™t be stupid.
